1. Queen Auther 'the Deep-Minded' of Norway

* A somewhat humble beginning, only having the chiefdom of Vestrland in Iceland.
* Amidst all the pagans of her norse people she was the only ruler who saw the potential in religious conversion.
* She was tired of all the sacrifices and needless bloodshed by those wanting to get to valhalla. 
  There was no goal of progress, of moving through time and making something new in the old Asatro. 
  She had always been quicker than most, she studied the new religion to the best of her abilities.
In the hope to get the attention and support of the head of faith, the pope.
After studying and going on pilgrimages she become genuinely interested in the riddle of existence.
  All the wisdom that the church had been massive, and she stockpiled on knowledge in her own libraries.
She had always been treated by her catholic peers as lesser because she was a woman, this had always annoyed her.
  God created the duality, so why favour only one part?
In a while she became interested in mysticism and later found books on magic. She made an ancient ritual,
  becoming a witch and showing her grandDaughter Auther II the secrets of the horned god.
Had her secret been known to the catholic world she would have been a criminal in their eyes.
  This disillusioned her with the faith. She started to see that the pope was all about control.
"Do that, don't do this. Do as I say. You are born of sin, you need to repent, so go do this"
- A religion based on fear, the sheep following the shepherd for fear of the wolf.
Yet when she read jesus he always talked about love. Love was the great power who moved the world.
  It was the basis of existence, why not cultivate it and make it grow here, right now?
This was the progress she that first inspired her upon her pious path, so she created a new religion based on love.
  Inspired by her norse roots who worshipped Freya, the god of love, she created
Freyaism. A religion of feasts, companionship and acceptance. She knew her body well and just as she was about to die,
  she converted her country that now was 18 counties big, Iceland, Faroe Islands and the southern part of Norway.
Ironically, her daughter would show love in the complete opposite way.

2. Queen Katarina of Norway

* She was never as quick or loved as her mother yet nevertheless she loved her mother very deeply.
  She saw her new religion as her mothers legacy and hers to promote.
* From the get go her vassals did not like her and plotted to overthrow her.
  She was always quite the little liar and schemer, a rascal. The new religion made no judgement upon her,
  and she thought she showed her love by forwarding it upon the world, no matter the means.
She abducted many and forced them to convert, to spread this new religion. She murdered many more,
  to destabilize factions against her. She tortured for her own enjoyment and became known
as a dreaded queen not to trifle with. She was lustful and had many lovers, producing nine children in total.
  Before her death she managed to convert at least one other catholic country to freyaism, Aquitaine.
  Her daughter Auther was the jarl of Faroe, yet with her genius she conquered two other duchies in Britain.
  Katarina had her focus on her mothers goal, the kingdom of Norway. She conquered all but a little county,
  yet in the heathens control.
