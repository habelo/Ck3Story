<h1>Queen Auther 'the Deep-Minded' of Norway</h1>
<p>

    <br>A somewhat humble beginning, only having the chiefdom of Vestrland in Iceland.
    <br>
     Amidst all the pagans of her norse people she was the only ruler who saw the potential in religious conversion.
    <br>
     She was tired of all the sacrifices and needless bloodshed by those wanting to get to valhalla.
    <br>
    There was no goal of progress, of moving through time and making something new in the old Asatro.
    <br>
    She had always been quicker than most, she studied the new religion to the best of her abilities.
    <br>
    In the hope to get the attention and support of the head of faith, the pope.
    <br>
    After studying and going on pilgrimages she become genuinely interested in the riddle of existence.
    <br>
    All the wisdom that the church had been massive, and she stockpiled on knowledge in her own libraries.
    <br>
    She had always been treated by her catholic peers as lesser because she was a woman, this had always annoyed her.
    <br>
    God created the duality, so why favour only one part?
    <br>
    In a while she became interested in mysticism and later found books on magic. She made an ancient ritual,
    <br>
    becoming a witch and showing her grandDaughter Auther II the secrets of the horned god.
    <br>
    Had her secret been known to the catholic world she would have been a criminal in their eyes.
    <br>
    This disillusioned her with the faith. She started to see that the pope was all about control.
    <br>
    "Do that, don't do this. Do as I say. You are born of sin, you need to repent, so go do this"
    <br>
    - A religion based on fear, the sheep following the shepherd for fear of the wolf.
    <br>
    Yet when she read jesus he always talked about love. Love was the great power who moved the world.
    <br>
    It was the basis of existence, why not cultivate it and make it grow here, right now?
    <br>
    This was the progress she that first inspired her upon her pious path, so she created a new religion based on love.
    <br>
    Inspired by her norse roots who worshipped Freya, the god of love, she created
    <br>
    Freyaism. A religion of feasts, companionship and acceptance. She knew her body well and just as she was about to die,
    <br>
    she converted her country that now was 18 counties big, Iceland, Faroe Islands and the southern part of Norway.
    <br>
    Ironically, her daughter would show love in the complete opposite way.</p>

<h1>Queen Katarina of Norway</h1>
<p>
    She was never as quick or loved as her mother yet nevertheless she loved her mother very deeply.
    <br>
    She saw her new religion as her mothers legacy and hers to promote.
    <br>
    From the get go her vassals did not like her and plotted to overthrow her.
    <br>
    She was always quite the little liar and schemer, a rascal. The new religion made no judgement upon her,
    <br>
    and she thought she showed her love by forwarding it upon the world, no matter the means.
    <br>
    She abducted many and forced them to convert, to spread this new religion. She murdered many more,
    <br>
    to destabilize factions against her. She tortured for her own enjoyment and became known
    <br>
    as a dreaded queen not to trifle with. She was lustful and had many lovers, producing nine children in total.
    <br>
    Before her death she managed to convert at least one other catholic country to freyaism, Aquitaine.
    <br>
    Her daughter Auther was the jarl of Faroe, yet with her genius she conquered two other duchies in Britain.
    <br>
    Katarina had her focus on her mothers goal, the kingdom of Norway. She conquered all but a little county,
    <br>
    yet in the heathens control.</p>
